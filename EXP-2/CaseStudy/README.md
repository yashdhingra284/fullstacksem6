Case Study Overview

This Case Study is a frontend-only Single Page Application (SPA) designed as part of a case study.
It provides a simple and modern interface for students to view courses, enroll in them, and give feedback.

I used the following technoogies for doing this case study.

React JS – Frontend framework

Vite – Development and build tool

Bootstrap 5 – Layout, grid system, spacing, responsiveness

Material UI (MUI) – Cards, buttons, typography, and UI components

React Router DOM – Navigation within the single-page application

CSS – Custom styling and UI enhancements

I used Bootstrap for:

--> Grid system

--> Layout structure

--> Spacing and responsiveness

I used Material UI for:

--> Cards

--> Buttons

--> Typography

--> Interactive UI elements
