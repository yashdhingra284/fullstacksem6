This is the third experiment of FUllStack Sem-6.
In this experiment we learnt to implement routing using React Router. It helps us to create links between different pages on a website.

Using this functionality we developed three sub-projects which are as follows.

    1> Implementing Routing in Single Page Application
        In this sub-experiment we created a simple page on which Home is written and another with About written and implemented routing and moved to different pages by just changing the url of the page.

    2> Navigation using link component
        In this experiment we created two pages one named 'Dashboard' which included Skills of the user and another one named 'Profile' which included personal details about the user.

        We added navlinks to move between pages as well as we added a link to profile page in the name of the website written on the left of the navbar.

        We also added dedicated buttons on each page to move from one page to another.

    3> Multipage SPA using routing.
        In this experiment we created two pages one named 'Dashboard' which included Skills of the user and another one named 'Profile' which included personal details about the user.

        We added navlinks to move between pages.
